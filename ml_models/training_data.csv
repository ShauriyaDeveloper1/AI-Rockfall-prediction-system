Event-based inventory contains details of some of the major triggering events suchas Kedarnathand Kerala disasters, and Sikkim earthquake as well asfew large valley blocking landslides. Route-wise inventory contains details of landslides along selected routes of tourist and pilgrimage importance. Satellitedata of high to very high resolution such as IRS-1D PAN+LISS-III, Resourcesat-1, 2 and 2A LISS-IV Mx, Cartosat-1and 2S, data from International satellites (Sentinel-1&2, Pleiades and WorldView) and Aerial images were used inthe mapping of landslides.
